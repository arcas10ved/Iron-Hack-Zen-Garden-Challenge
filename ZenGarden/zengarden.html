            <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
            <p>
                Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific
                tags, incompatible <u>DOMs</u>, broken <u>CSS</u> support, and abandoned
                browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
                achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the <u>W3C</u>, <u>WaSP</u>, and
                the major browser creators.

                The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
                lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-
                honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with
                the web.

            <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
            <p>
                There is a continuing need to show the power of <u>CSS</u>. The Zen Garden
                aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some
                of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style
                sheet into this very page. The <u>HTML</u> remains the same, the only thing that
                has changed is the external <u>CSS</u> file. Yes, really.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>CSS</u> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this
                can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the
                reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike
                have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.
            </p>

            <h3>Participation</h3>
            <p>
                Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this
                page, so strong <u>CSS</u> skills are necessary too, but the example files are
                commented well enough that even <u>CSS</u> novices can use them as starting
                points. Please see the <span><u>CSS Resource Guide</u></span> for advanced tutorials and
                tips on working with <u>CSS</u>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <u>HTML</u>.
                This may seem daunting at first if you've never worked this way before,
                but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a
                guide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Download the sample <span><u>HTML</u></span> and <span><u>CSS</u></span> to work on a copy locally. Once
                you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit half-finished
                work) upload your <u>CSS</u> file to a web server under your control.
                <span><u>Send us a link</u></span> to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we
                choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.

                Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all
                refer to showing people how amazing <u>CSS</u> really can be. This site serves
                as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning
                tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we
                can all look forward to.
